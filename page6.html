<p>After an Assault</p>
<p>Sexual assault can take an immeasurable toll on the victim's physical and mental health. The emotional and physical scars of an assault can deeply impact a student's ability to cope with academic, social, professional, and personal responsibilities. While the idea of asking for help may feel scary, overwhelming, or even impossible, it's an important first step on the road to recovery. On its website, RAINN suggests a variety of methods for survivors to cope with their trauma and its aftereffects, including professional therapy, strategies for exposure to media representations of sexual assault, and even advice for dealing with airport security screenings.</p>

<p><strong>1 IN 10 RAPE VICTIMS CURRENTLY SUFFER FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER; 3 IN 10 WILL DEVELOP PTSD OVER THEIR LIFETIME.</strong></p>

<p><strong>After an Assault: Immediate Steps</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get to a safe place:</strong> The most important thing is your safety. Get away from your assailant and get to a location where you can call for help. Ideally, find a secure place where you aren't alone. This can include a campus health center, or the home of a nearby friend or family member.</p>

<p><strong>Contact the authorities:</strong> Call 911 to report the incident right away. Provide the dispatcher with the time and place of the incident, and a description of your assailant. Wait for the police to arrive so that they can collect your statement.</p>

<p><strong>Get medical attention:</strong> Even if you don't think it's necessary, seek medical attention at a doctor's office, urgent care clinic, or a hospital as soon as possible. Doctors can help collect vital evidence and treat your injuries directly after an assault.</p>

<p><strong>Advocacy: </strong>RAINN suggests calling the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE to request hospital referrals and check the availability of an emergency advocate who can help you through the medical examination.</p>

<p><strong>Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE):</strong> These professionals are trained to conduct victim examinations, document injuries, and collect DNA evidence that can prove useful in identifying an assailant. Potential evidence includes hair, skin, and bodily fluid samples.</p>

<p><strong>Emergency Contraception:</strong> Victims can reduce their chance of pregnancy by taking Plan B up to 120 hours after an attack.</p>

<p><strong>STI Testing:</strong> Get screened for possible infections that can be transmitted during unwanted sexual contact.</p>

<p>To preserve evidence of threats or assault, RAINN advises victims to write down details about the attack and the attacker as soon after the incident as possible. This information will help doctors, police, and campus authorities in the hours and days after an attack. Do not change your clothes, shower, brush your teeth, or clean the scene of the crime until you have seen a medical professional. If you think you may have been drugged, the federal Office of Women's Health advises you to ask for a urinalysis during your medical examination.</p>

<p><strong>After an Assault: Moving Forward</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make safe arrangements: </strong>If you live with an abusive partner, make arrangements with your dorm staff, a safe home, or friends to relocate to a new residence. To prevent future incidents, do not let your assailant know where you will be living.</p>

<p><strong>Seek counseling:</strong> Contact your campus health service office and inform them you need a crisis counselor who specializes in sexual assault. You can also contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE to speak with a counselor over the phone immediately.</p>

<p><strong>File a civil protection order (CPO):</strong> If you know the identity of your assailant, you can pursue a protection order, also known as a restraining order. A court can order your attacker to stay away from you and refrain from any communication with you. An assailant who violates a CPO can face criminal charges. The American Bar Association has put together resources regarding sexual assault CPO procedures for all 50 states.</p>

<p><strong>If Someone You Know Is Assaulted</p></strong>
<p>Safety is more important than anything else. Help the victim reach a safe location away from the assailant. Make the victim feel as safe as possible.</p>

<p>Many victims blame themselves for an attack. Tell the victim that the sexual assault was not their fault.</p>

<p>Be a supportive listener. Thank the victim for telling you it happened. Tell them you believe their story, and that they won't have to deal with this alone.</p>

<p>If you saw the attacker or witnessed any part of the assault, take detailed notes about what you saw.</p>

<p>Accompany the victim to the hospital and ensure that they meet with medical professionals who specialize in sexual assault trauma.</p>

<p>Follow up with the victim. Encourage them to seek counseling and support groups.</p>

<p><strong>After an Assault: Recovery</p></strong>
<p>Survivors often struggle with resuming their normal daily activities in the aftermath of a sexual assault. Victims should work with their physicians, counselors, and instructors to take the appropriate time off from classes and other academic responsibilities to recover from their trauma. Even after physical wounds heal, physical and emotional scars can serve as painful reminders of the incident; survivors suffer the risk of chronic emotional distress.</p>

<p><strong>RAINN lists the following as some of the most common aftereffects of sexual violence:</p></strong>

<p>Depression</p>
<p>Disassociation</p>
<p>Eating disorders</p>
<p>Flashbacks</p>
<p>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</p>
<p>Pregnancy</p>
<p>Self-harm</p>
<p>Sexually transmitted infections</p>
<p>Sleep disorders</p>
<p>Substance abuse</p>
<p>Suicidal thoughts</p>
<p>With the right help, there are ways to cope with these aftereffects. Due to the often serious degree of trauma that comes with an attack, it is extremely important for victims of sexual assault to seek professional help. Victims might not feel like they need counseling; however, the emotional and mental fallout can manifest suddenly, especially during periods of high stress.</p>
